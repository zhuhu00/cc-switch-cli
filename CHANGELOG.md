## [4.2.6] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- **Codex**: Allow switching providers when `~/.codex/auth.json` is absent (credential store / keyring mode).

## [4.2.5] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- **Interactive**: Use `←/→` on the main menu to switch the current application.

## [4.2.4] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- **Interactive**: Press `Esc` to go back to the previous step (no more “Selection cancelled” errors).

## [4.2.3] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed

- **Interactive**: Clear the terminal between screens/menus to prevent ghosting (“拖影”) and keep the UI clean.

## [4.2.2] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed

- **Interactive**: The common config snippet editor now uses the same external editor flow as provider JSON editing (opens your `$EDITOR` via external editor). Fixes #11.

## [4.2.1] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- **Interactive**: Add a JSON editor in `⚙️ Configuration Management → 🧩 Common Config Snippet` to edit/apply per-app common config snippets (Claude use-case: shared env like `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`). Fixes #11.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- **Common Config Snippet**: Add `cc-switch config common` to manage per-app common config snippets (useful for shared Claude settings like `env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` and `includeCoAuthoredBy`). Fixes #11.

### Changed

- **Claude**: Merge the common config snippet into the live `~/.claude/settings.json` when switching providers.
- **Claude**: Strip values matching the common snippet when backfilling provider snapshots, so common settings stay global across providers.

## [4.1.4] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed

- **Providers (Interactive)**: When adding the first provider for an app, auto-set it as the current provider (prevents “current provider is empty” and unlocks switching). Fixes #10.

## [4.1.3] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed

- **Codex (0.63+)**: Avoid writing `env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"` into `~/.codex/config.toml` by default (prevents `Missing environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- **Codex**: Generate provider config using `requires_openai_auth = true` for OpenAI-auth flows; interactive provider add/edit now lets you choose auth mode.

## [4.1.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added

  - Full-featured provider creation with validation

  - Delete prompts from all configured apps at once
  - Proper cleanup of prompt files and configuration

### Changed

- **Interactive Mode Refactoring**: Reorganized into modular structure (~1,254 lines reorganized)
